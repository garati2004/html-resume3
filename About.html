<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm a 19-year-old, and I'm currently in my third year at Saint Joseph University in Beirut, where I'm studying to become a doctor. Learning is my jam, and I'm always on the lookout to acquire new skills and knowledge. You could call me perseverant – when I set my mind to something, I see it through, no matter what.</p>

<p>One thing I absolutely love is helping people. It gives me such a sense of fulfillment and purpose. Back in school, I used to work on some fantastic projects that brought positive change to our community. It's incredible how a group effort can make a difference!</p>

<p>Living in Beirut is exciting; there's always something happening. To keep myself balanced, I enjoy swimming, reading, and going on hikes – it clears my mind and helps me stay focused. Oh, and I'm an adventure enthusiast! Traveling to new places is one of my favorite things; it broadens my horizons and makes me appreciate the diversity of the world we live in. So, that's a bit about me – a passionate, driven individual, aspiring to make a positive impact in the world of medicine and beyond.</p>
